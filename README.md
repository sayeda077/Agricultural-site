# Agricultural-site
This is an agricultural project which provides some services for farmers and fisherman. The proposed system is a web-based application. The system will contain some services for the users such as they can post their problem as well as they can take a loan if needed. This project is about a agricultural website where farmers and fisherman can easily share their problem and can take load if needed. The system will require a register page in database where they have to register their name, age, work-field, branch etc attribute, they can also update and delete their info.The proposed system is designed to eliminate some problems of farmers and fisherman usually they face. By using this system, the farmers of Bangladesh who typically donâ€™t get the proper price can get it. Sometimes they need the loan which they get from the chairman of the village with high interest. By this, most of the time, they lose their homestead also. For these reasons, we will design a system from which they can quickly get the loan with very low interest.
